# D-separation for cyclic mixed graphs code from paper:
# "Constraint-Based Causal Discovery: Conflict Resolution with Answer Set Programming"
# By Antti Hyttinen, Frederick Eberhardt, Matti JÃ¤rvisalo
# The code below has the same logic as the original, with some non-functional changes.
# Keep in mind that indexing in Python starts at zero while indexing in R starts at one.

  #J      vector of variable indexes in the intervention set  
  #D      binary matrix of directed edges, G[i,j] = 1 means j->i is present
  #B      symmetric binary matrix of bidirected edges <-> , for latent confounding
  #U      symmetric binary matrix of undirected edges --- , should be empty at beginning

  #Note that this is not currently the most efficient implementation.
  #-One could use matrix operations
  #-One could calculate more of the relations all at once.
